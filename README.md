A Habit Calendar implemented on the [Pimoroni Cosmic Unicorn](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/space-unicorns?variant=40842626596947)

The Cosmic Unicorn [Schematic](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0174/1800/files/cosmic_unicorn_schematic.pdf?v=1677236038).

## Development Environment

I am using Visual Studio Code.

Install the MicroPico (Pico-W-Go) extension in order to connect to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, that is used on the Cosmic Unicorn.

## Wifi Setup

Create 'wifi.py' with the following content:

```
WIFI_SSID = 'ssid'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'pwd'
```
Obviously change the ssid and pwd to those applicable to your wifi network.
